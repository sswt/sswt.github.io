## 3. Fighting Escalates in Eastern DRC

start: 00:00:50.780, duration: 176.44

- **Summary:** Doctors Without Borders calls for civilian protection and aid access as heavy fighting continues between M23 rebels and the army in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.  The report covers the recent M23 takeover of Bukavu, human rights abuses, and the ongoing conflict.
- **Key persons:** ['Alain Waikani (Al Jazeera Reporter)']
- **Summary (ru):** В репортаже рассказывается о продолжающихся боевых действиях между повстанческими силами M23 и армией в Восточной Демократической Республике Конго, захвате города Букаву повстанцами, а также о гуманитарных последствиях и обвинениях в нарушениях прав человека.

News Anchor: the protection of civilians and humanitarian access as heavy fighting between M23 rebel forces and the army continues in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Alain Waikani has traveled across Lake Kivu from Goma to Bukavu. The ports have just reopened after weeks of fighting. Alain reports from Bukavu that's been recently taken by M23 forces.

Alain Waikani: The Congo River Alice, which M23 is part of, met residents of Bukavu. Thousand turned up to listen to what the rebels had to say. The fighters took the city on Sunday, they overrun the airport and have been rapidly advancing further south. Two people died at this hospital. A dozen others are nursing gunshots wounds.

Civilian: It was Sunday. I was in the house when I heard the gunfire sound. I was sitting in my living room chair when the bullet hit my leg. At the same time, my husband carried me up to the road, where the ambulance picked me up and brought me here.

UN Representative: The UN blames M23 for human rights abuses. Our office has confirmed cases of summary execution of children by M23 after they entered the city of Bukavu last week. We're also aware that children were in possession of weapons. We call on Rwanda and M23 to ensure that human rights and international humanitarian law are respected. We're also documenting cases of ill-treatment, conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence, child and forced recruitment, intimidation and death threats.

M23 Representative: The rebels have accused fleeing government soldiers of shooting civilians and stealing from them. We feel sad because when we arrived, there was no order. Residents lost their property. Children of army soldiers mishandled guns and killed each other. We saw Mai Mai and Wazalendo militia steal property.

Alain Waikani: In North Kivu, Congolese Nbutembo-Beni territory line up to unleashed fight against M23 and its allies. Beni is the last remaining government stronghold in this region. The group says it wants to control the region which are rich in rare earth minerals. Many Congolese say they want the conflict resolved so they can rebuild their lives. It's almost four weeks right now since the DRC army is not showing the sign of reorganizing the offensive against the M23 on the ground. The army is losing more ground. The M23 advancing in different key areas here in the province of South Kivu and even in the other side of Lubero. Now population are wondering, in the absence of the dialogue with this rebel which was refused by the government of Kinshasa, how these authorities of the country will deal with this situation as now the panic is going widely across the country and people are worrying for what may happen as the rebels are moving forward up to now.

## 4. South Korean President Yoon's Impeachment Trial

start: 00:03:47.220, duration: 111.0

- **Summary:** Yoon Suk-yeol, the impeached South Korean president, appeared in court for a criminal case related to his declaration of martial law. The court is also considering his release from detention, amidst the ongoing constitutional court hearings regarding his impeachment.
- **Key persons:** ['Yoon Suk-yeol (Impeached South Korean President)', 'Rob McBride (Al Jazeera Reporter)', 'Choi Sang-mok (Acting President)', 'Donald Trump (US President)']
- **Summary (ru):** Бывший президент Южной Кореи Юн Сок Ёль предстал перед судом по обвинению в мятеже за объявление военного положения в прошлом году, что привело к его импичменту. Одновременно Конституционный суд рассматривает дело об импичменте, а страна находится в политической неопределенности.

Yoon Suk-yeol has become the first sitting president of South Korea to appear in court in a criminal case. He's been charged with insurrection for declaring martial law last year that led to his impeachment. Rob McBride reports from Seoul.

Amid heavy security, impeached president Yoon Suk-yeol was brought to Seoul Central District Court for the first hearing of this landmark criminal case. It follows Yoon's declaration of martial law last December, which was quickly lifted after members of the besieged National Assembly voted to overturn it. Yoon has argued it was meant more as a warning to opposition parties, who he says were stopping him from governing. All this talk about who ordered what and who received what orders, it feels like chasing moonlight reflections on a lake. The court also heard a motion from Yoon's lawyers for his release from the detention center, where he's been held since his arrest last month. I believe it has been explained that the current detention is in a legal confinement and that the grounds for detention have ceased to exist. The start of this criminal case comes as the constitutional court on the other side of Seoul is wrapping up its hearings into Yoon's impeachment to decide if he should be removed from office. As this drama is playing out in the courts, the country remains in a kind of political and diplomatic limbo. The acting president, Choi Sang-mok, has not yet even spoken on the phone with President Donald Trump, the leader of South Korea's most important ally at a time when the U.S. is threatening tariffs on steel, cars and semiconductor chips, some of South Korea's most important exports. Rob McBride, Al Jazeera, Seoul.

## 5. Concerns over Migrant Deportations to Panama

start: 00:05:38.220, duration: 167.0

- **Summary:** Rights groups express concerns about the safety of migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama, where they are reportedly being held against their will. This follows agreements between the Trump administration and several Central American countries to accept deportees.
- **Key persons:** ['Julia Galeano (Al Jazeera Reporter)', 'Jose Raul Mulino (Panamanian President)', 'Marco Rubio (U.S. Secretary of State)']
- **Summary (ru):** Правозащитные группы выражают обеспокоенность по поводу безопасности мигрантов, депортированных из США в Панаму, где их содержат под стражей без юридических оснований и дальнейших планов, что вызывает критику и вопросы о законности таких действий.

Rights groups have raised concerns about the safety of migrants deported from the U.S. to Panama. Panama's government has agreed to take in and organize the repatriation of those from countries refusing to accept deportation flights from America. Julia Galeano has more from Mexico City. This situation has been nothing short of a public relations disaster for the Panamanian government, and that is largely due to the secrecy with which this situation has been handled. Essentially, we learned from the president himself, Jose Raul Mulino, last week, that some 300 deportees from different nations coming from the U.S. had arrived in Panama. But despite requests for more information, such as who they were, where were they going, what were the next steps, no more information was given. And it was only on Tuesday that we learned from a story that the New York Times wrote that these people were actually being kept against their will in a hotel in Panama City, and that they were going to be transferred to a camp in a very remote area of the Darien province in Panama. So now the conversation has shifted in Panama to the legality of what's going on. There's some 300 people who are now detained in this country where they have committed no crime, and there seems to be no legal roadmap to what comes next for them, which has, of course, prompted civil organizations to point out the fact that this is in flagrant violation of several international and national laws in Panama. The security minister of the country has said that these people aren't detained, that in fact they're just being held in order to protect them from potential human smugglers that may want to take advantage of them. And I think what we're seeing here right now is the initial fallout of these agreements that the Trump administration has made with several countries in Central America, which include Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador. During a recent visit by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, it was announced that all of these countries would take back deportees, not only of their own nationalities, but rather, you know, deportees from all different nationalities. And there was no legal roadmap, there was no more further explanation as to how this process would work. What would happen, as we're seeing right now in the case of Panama, with people that simply refuse to voluntarily go back to their own countries citing security concerns? Would they remain detained? Would they be offered asylum in the country that they arrive in? So I think now, today, it's Panama, but certainly in the coming days and weeks, if these flights continue, I think we'll be seeing similar confusion taking place in these countries as well.

## 6. German Election and Foreign Policy

start: 00:08:25.220, duration: 165.0

- **Summary:** Foreign policy, particularly defense spending and trade relations with the U.S., is a major issue in the upcoming German elections.  The report highlights the impact of the Ukraine war and U.S. pressure on European defense spending.
- **Key persons:** ['Dominic Cain (Al Jazeera Reporter)', 'Olaf Scholz (German Chancellor)', 'Friedrich Merz (Christian Democrat Leader)', 'Donald Trump (US President)']
- **Summary (ru):** В преддверии выборов в Германии важную роль играет внешняя политика, особенно вопросы оборонных расходов в свете войны в Украине и призывов США к увеличению расходов, а также торговые отношения с США.

Foreign policy will play an important role when voters in Germany go to the polls on Sunday. Since the end of the Second World War, defence spending has been diverted to other areas, but the war in Ukraine and calls by the U.S. President for Europe to increase defence spending are changing that. Dominic Cain reports from Berlin. German fighting vehicles on manoeuvres in Lithuania. They're a public show of their country's commitment to NATO's eastern flank, part of a 5,000-strong brigade in the Baltic state. When Russia invaded Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz responded with record funding to boost the armed forces. The $125 billion investment helped push defence spending to 2% of GDP, a key NATO target. But the Trump White House wants European countries to spend more, much more. And that has annoyed ministers in Berlin. It will be very important for the future of Europe that we enable everybody to do what is necessary for them. In this respect, it's very good that a very careful debate has now begun. As I said, in my view, Germany can accept allowing member states to spend more than 2% on their defence. Broadly speaking, the Christian Democrat leader Friedrich Merz shares this view. But he's also said he's deeply pessimistic about the prospects for Ukraine, following the U.S. decision to exclude the EU from talks with Russia about ending the war. The U.S. president's agenda on trade tariffs is another priority for the next German government. Its automotive and pharmaceutical sectors are particularly exposed. Taken together, the two generated $38 billion in exports to the U.S. in 2023. The steel industry is also coming to terms with reimposed tariffs, which could lead to a drop in output. Here too, broadly speaking, shots and mouts have a similar view. Most of the things Trump is saying now are not new. He's talked about them again and again. There are considerable concerns on this side of the Atlantic about what is still to come. This makes it all the more important that we are as united as possible and react. The United States has been a guarantor of security in Europe for almost 80 years. Its military and trade presence helping provide conditions for prosperity. Now both of those are in question. Meaning whoever leads the next government will face immediate, difficult foreign policy questions. Dominic Cain, Al Jazeera, at the German Chancellery. Finally, this bulletin.

Speaker 1: And it comes quite a long way south, as you can see. Speaker 1: Toyama's around about in here. Speaker 1: Beyond it though, and the air that's providing this potential, Speaker 1: is the cold stuff in the sunshine coming out of north-eastern China. Speaker 1: That sunshine disappears the further south you come. Speaker 1: There has been rain for a time south of the Yangtze. Speaker 1: And that rebuilds and comes across again for later on Saturday. Speaker 1: And where it's cold enough, or high enough, you get some snow out of that too.

## 10. Inside Story: US-Russia Talks on Ukraine

start: 00:13:46.220, duration: 1710.0

- **Summary:** Inside Story discusses the recent US-Russian talks in Saudi Arabia about the war in Ukraine, which excluded Ukrainian and European leaders. The program explores the implications of these talks, Trump's stance on the conflict, and the potential consequences for Ukraine and the transatlantic relationship.
- **Key persons:** ['James Bayes (Host)', 'Alexandra Byers (Reporter)', 'Donald Trump (US President)', 'Vladimir Zelenskyy (Ukrainian President)', 'Vladimir Putin (Russian President)', 'Anatole Levin (Director of the Eurasia programme at the Quincy Institute)', 'Andrei Kortunov (Political analyst)', 'Mateja Neles (Political analyst and CEO of the German-Ukrainian Bureau)']
- **Summary (ru):** В Саудовской Аравии прошли переговоры между США и Россией по вопросу войны в Украине, но без участия представителей Украины и ЕС. Президент Зеленский раскритиковал эти переговоры, а Дональд Трамп обвинил Киев в развязывании войны.

James Bayes: Hello again, I'm James Bayes.

US and Russian delegates: [gathered in Saudi Arabia's capital to discuss the war]

James Bayes: ...the first meeting of its kind in three years. But Ukrainian and European Union leaders weren't invited. Ukraine's military is reliant on US weapons to fight Russia's invasion. President Trump's decisions are putting Kyiv under increasing pressure, making it feel it's little more than a bargaining chip. Ukrainians want peace, but not at any cost. Meanwhile, President Putin seems to have already divided the US and EU, creating the worst fracture in the transatlantic relationship since World War II. Russia's diplomatic isolation is over. So is it time for the European allies to create new economic and military strategies? And what does this all mean for Ukraine? We'll be asking those questions to our guests in a moment. But first, this report from Alexandra Byers.

Alexandra Byers: For many people watching around the world, an extraordinary change in relationship. Senior officials from the U.S. and Russia together at a negotiating table for four-and-a-half hours in the Saudi capital on Tuesday, the first meeting of its kind since Russian forces invaded Ukraine three years ago. While campaigning for the presidency, Donald Trump said he would end the war, while blaming Kyiv for starting it.

Donald Trump: This could have been settled very easily. Just a half-baked negotiator could have settled this years ago without, I think, without the loss of much land, very little land, without the loss of any lives.

Alexandra Byers: Neither the Ukrainian president nor European leaders were invited to the meeting in Riyadh, a move that's angered many. Volodymyr Zelenskyy postponed a planned visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday, saying he didn't want to legitimize the talks.

Unnamed Speaker: All of this definitely doesn't have a positive impact on Ukraine. They're letting Putin out of isolation. And I think Putin and Russia are really happy because they're involved in discussions. And yesterday, there were signals that they are the victims. That's something new.

Alexandra Byers: Even so, the U.S. is pushing ahead, announcing plans to create teams for peace talks. Washington says it will continue consulting Kyiv and Brussels, but direct negotiations will only be with Moscow. And it's made clear that all options are open.

Unnamed Speaker: In order to bring an end to any conflict, there has to be concessions made by all sides. We're not going to predetermine what those are.

Alexandra Byers: The U.S. has floated Russia, keeping Ukrainian territory it seized, the lifting of sanctions on Moscow and its readmission to the G7, and the blocking of Ukraine's long-sought membership of NATO.

Unnamed Speaker: President Trump was the first and I think the only Western leader who has publicly and loudly said that the one of the root causes of the Ukrainian situation was the impotent line of the previous administration to draw Ukraine into NATO. No Western leader has said that, but he said it repeatedly.

Alexandra Byers: Both the Kremlin and the White House say a meeting between Presidents Trump and Putin is planned for the next month or two, all while the war continues on the ground. After three years of fighting, it's officially claimed 150,000 lives. But international monitors agree the actual death toll is likely to be much higher. Alexandra Byers, Al Jazeera, for Inside Story.

James Bayes: Well, let's discuss all this further with our guests today on the programme. In Washington DC, Anatole Levin, director of the Eurasia programme at the Quincy Institute and a member of the Valdai Club, the Russian think tank. In Moscow, Andrei Kortunov, political analyst, author and former director general of the Russian International Affairs Council. And in Dusseldorf in Germany, Mateja Neles, political analyst and CEO of the German-Ukrainian Bureau, a think tank. Thank you, all three of you, for talking to us. Pretty important developments with regard to Ukraine. Anatole, let me start with you. How significant is what we've seen in Riyadh, not just for Ukraine, but for the global order?

Anatole Levin: Well, it's an immense significance that it seems that the Trump administration wants to bring Russia back into some form of new security architecture in Russia. In Europe. I mean, if that can be achieved, it would be transformative, because this is something that Russians, and not just Russians, I mean, many Europeans as well, have hoped for since the end of the Cold War, but have not achieved. But, of course, this depends on the success of the peace negotiations on Ukraine. And there is an enormous amount which is still not clear. Certain things have been decided, or rather, actually just recognised because they've been clear for many years, such as Ukrainian neutrality. But, of course, so many other things about the details of an eventual peace settlement remain totally unclear, and we still don't know for sure that such a settlement can be achieved.

James Bayes: Andrei, this meeting lasted just over four hours, but how important do you think could be the repercussions going forward?

Andrei Kortunov: Well, judging from the initial reactions that we have received here in Moscow, the Russian leadership feels more or less happy with the outcome of this meeting. Of course, this optimism is qualified. They don't want to inflate public expectations. Therefore, they argue that we are just in the very beginning of a very long road. And they also emphasise the importance of changing the bilateral relationship, specifically the relationship between the United States and the Russian Federation. A lot of emphasis is put on restoration of the diplomatic dialogue. And I think that on the Ukrainian settlement there is probably less optimism and less information that the Russian side can share at this particular juncture.

James Bayes: And, Andrei, you seem to suggest they're playing it rather cool in Moscow, but this must be very good news for Putin and his government.

Andrei Kortunov: Well, you know, again, you know, I don't want to say that the mood is pessimistic, but they clearly tried to manage public expectations, not to create an impression that we are moving towards a new reset. But the overall reaction is clearly positive. And this is a very radical departure from the earlier comments on the U.S. foreign policy and even on the foreign policy of the Trump administration.

James Bayes: Okay. Mathieu, they are worried about this. I think it's fair to say where you are in Germany and across Western Europe. A quote here from Jean-Yves Le Drian, the former French foreign minister. It's a reversal of the state of the world since 1945. Would you agree with that?

Matija Neles: I certainly would agree with that. And we Europeans, we Germans are taken aback by the astonishing speed of what appears to be the normalization of the Russian Federation. Again, after three years of intensive diplomatic pressure by sanctions, military support for Ukraine, we see an upending of the United, you know, Western efforts to bring about an end to this war in Ukraine. And, of course, talks as such were to be expected, but they are now happening. I wouldn't call them negotiations yet. These are talks between Russia and America over the heads of the Ukrainians, over the heads of the Europeans. And that is certainly worrying for us and raises an alarming amount of questions.

James Bayes: Anatole, excuse the pun, but Trump has already given away some of his Trump cards, hasn't he, here, in terms of the negotiation. First, just the fact this talks took place at this level after over three years. This effectively ends Russia's pariah status, ends its diplomatic isolation.

Anatole Levin: Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that. After all, talks had to take place at some stage. And, you know, time is not on Ukraine's side in this war. You know, the Russians are advancing. The Ukrainians are suffering very badly. There is a risk, though we don't know how heavy, but it has been discussed by Western analysts, of Ukrainian collapse. So if you're going to decide on peace talks, there's no point in spinning them out. You might as well, you know, start them at a high level and get on with them. But I think also some of these European fears are greatly exaggerated. I mean, from 1945 to 1991, Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union and Soviet forces were in the middle of Germany, you know, 50 miles from the Rhine and the French border. I mean, nobody is thinking that we're going to go back to that. This will end with a compromise over Ukraine. By the way, I think it's also worth saying that, of course, any imaginable settlement now, I mean, unless, of course, Ukraine does collapse completely militarily, will be far, far short of what Putin hoped for when he launched this invasion in 2022. Both in terms of control over Ukraine, but also in terms later of Russian territorial ambitions.

James Bayes: But Anatoly, but Anatoly, he keeps, we think, at least some territory, possibly all the territory. So his invasion is being rewarded. That is not a principle that we normally have in international law, is it? I mean, the UN Charter says you're not allowed to invade other people's countries.

Anatole Levin: So what did we do against Turkey when it invaded Cyprus in 1974? Did we even expel it from NATO? No, we did not. I mean, the thing is, if you want to expel Russia from the territory it has taken, the Ukrainians have to win on the battlefield and drive the Russians out, which they can't do. And if they go on trying to do it, they will eventually destroy themselves. Or, of course, we can go to war with Russia. But every NATO government, including the Biden administration and all the Europeans, have said that we're not going to do that. So at some stage, one simply has to recognise reality.

James Bayes: Matea, your take on that, recognising reality, that's what's going on here. But yet again, these were talks with no Ukraine. OK, the very, very first round, but no Ukraine even invited to the talks.

Matija Neles: I fundamentally disagree with Anatoly here, because this war is not just about Ukraine. It's about, you know, the European peace order, which now lays in shatters, obviously. And if to reward Russia by accepting, maybe even de jure accepting, forcing Ukraine to accept the occupation and annexation of some of its territories, would completely destroy what's left of the European peace order. And this war is not just about Ukraine. It's about us. It's about principles of changing borders by force. So that's why it's important to repel the Russian aggression. I agree that, you know, right now Ukraine is not in a strong position. But by forcing it into hastily agreed talks and maybe in making deeper concessions will further weaken them. So we have to ask ourselves, what is at stake? And the Europeans are trying to find answers. And we get to that later. But it's worrying that America is turning inwards to China. And Europe has few options but to continue to support Ukraine. Ukraine, let me tell you that, will not accept a forced deal that is negotiated over the heads.

James Bayes: Andre, things moving very, very fast. If you look at the phone call between Trump and Putin, that was on Wednesday, the 12th of February. Six days later, the talks in Riyadh happened. And now Trump is talking about maybe meeting Putin face to face before the end of the month. Well, there are less than 10 days left this month. And it's interesting. It's actually the Kremlin that is walking that back, saying it may not be possible to organise it in that timeframe.

Andrei Kortunov: Well, my guess is that Donald Trump might be in a hurry, but Vladimir Putin is probably not, because the Russian authorities assume that time right now is on their side. They continue advancing in Donbas. They are trying not unsuccessfully to pull Ukrainians out of the Kursk region of the Russian Federation. So I don't think that they feel that there is a sense of urgency. They would like to prepare a summit meeting with Americans, to have these working groups, and to sort out not only the Ukrainian problem, but other problems between Moscow and Washington. So I think that though they do not want to delay the meeting, there is no such sense of urgency in Moscow as it probably is in Washington, D.C.

James Bayes: Anatole, I mean, we knew there would be an economic component to this and the possibility of lifting sanctions, but the official statement from the State Department talks about historic economic and investment opportunities in bringing peace. I mean, is this a bit premature? There would be those arguing that, given Russia was the aggressor, we should be talking about Russia paying reparations.

Anatole Levin: This is where the Europeans will have to be brought in, of course, when it comes to the reconstruction of Ukraine and when it comes to, I would strongly advocate not ending sanctions against Russia, but suspending them so as to have something to hold over Russia's head if it does resume aggression. But clearly, there have to be carrots in any peace negotiations. There have to be carrots as well as sticks. And suspending sanctions and resuming economic ties is one of them. I would say, though, that one thing which has been categorically rejected by the Ukrainian government, and quite rightly, is this extraordinary proposal by Trump that America should get its hands on, well, in effect, the whole of Ukraine's mineral reserves. Thereby, actually, according to Trump's calculations, at least, getting far more for America than America has given to Ukraine in aid. Well, I mean, that, of course, is utterly unacceptable.

James Bayes: Your view on that, Matea, the mineral plan. I mean, I spoke, I was in Munich at the security conference on the weekend. Some Europeans were saying to me this amounts to extortion. Now, a quote here from the former Swedish prime minister, Karl Bilt, blatant exploitation. It certainly looks like it.

Matija Neles: And Zelensky has no mandate to sign away 300 billion or 500 billion worth of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, some of which are on Russian-occupied territories. So this, even for paying for past or already delivered aid, that's a non-starter. But I generally believe that it was a smart idea by the Ukrainian side to prepare for Trump's government for the incoming administration last year. They developed the peace plan, the victory plan, and they also included this aspect. And knowing that it would appeal to Trump and certainly isn't in a Ukrainian interest and European interest to engage Americans in exploitation of Ukrainian resources. But it has to be a fair and balanced deal. It cannot just be Americans being paid for past eight or in the Ukrainians really want this to be part of a broader agreement. They want this to be part of the security arrangements. They want real security guarantees, maintaining this maybe fragile ceasefire. Without that, we cannot talk about resources or any peace.

James Bayes: Andre, if we look at the possible benefits for Russia economically, sanctions being lifted. And as I said, the State Department talking about economic, historic economic opportunities. This couldn't have come at a better time, could it, for Moscow? Because you live there, you can tell me. But my understanding is the Russian economy is really hurting now. Double-digit inflation. Interest rates standing at 21%, the highest in two decades.

Andrei Kortunov: Well, this is right. But to be fair to the Russian leadership, one has to say that the Russian economic system has demonstrated spectacular resilience to the pressure of economic sanctions. The macroeconomic situation is still under control. We do not have shortages. We do not have unemployment. The exchange rate is not really disastrous. And that's one of the reasons why the Russian public still stands behind the leadership, because many Russians simply do not feel the pressure of the war. But, of course, sanctions bite. It would be wrong to say that they do not affect the Russian economy. And I think that the problem that Russia has is that its economic relations with the West depend primarily on relations with Europe, not with the United States. And even if the United States lifts all the sanctions, which is unlikely, the European sanctions might still be there. And definitely that will be detrimental to the long term future of the Russian economy.

James Bayes: As I said, I was speaking to a number of European politicians in Munich at the weekend, and they all said to me they are still somewhat confused, Anatole, with the US plan, because you have different members of the delegation telling different European leaders different things about where this is going to go. At the talks, you had Mike Waltz, the National Security Adviser, Steve Witkoff, the special envoy. Not there was General Kellogg, who is supposed to be the special envoy for this issue, because Mr Witkoff is the Middle East special envoy. And, of course, Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This might, Anatole, be worth just telling you a little bit about Secretary Rubio, because he used to be a senator. And he seems to have changed his position on Ukraine. Let me just play a clip of what he said back in 2014.

Marco Rubio: They made up this excuse that somehow the Russian-speaking population in the region was being oppressed and attacked and was in danger, and so they needed to intervene. Even to this day, they still will not admit the military role that they are playing on the ground in Crimea. So, in addition to violating this international norm, which is an outrageous behavior, they have lied about it and think they can get away with it. And the point that I'm making is, if in the 21st century, a country is allowed to invade a neighbor, lie about it, and lie about the reasons for it, and they can get away with it without significant costs, we have created a dangerous precedent.

James Bayes: Anatole, can you see why some of the Europeans are confused, because they are getting different messages, not just historical messages from Senator Rubio, but I'm told getting different messages from different members of the Trump team. In the end, is it only Trump that matters?

Anatole Levin: Well, I mean, firstly, in response to Rubio's statement, which you just quoted, I mean, every one of those things could have been said about the US invasion of Iraq. So let's, you know, not pretend that Russia is unique in international aggression and defiance of international law. But as far as the Trump administration is concerned, well, I mean, there are two possibilities, both of which, by the way, could be true. The first is that, as we saw very much in the first Trump administration, it is a mess. You know, it's dysfunctional, chaotic, you have different people with different views clashing with each other. A more positive look at it would say that there's an element of playing good cop, bad cop. You know, some of them say, you know, we need good relations with Russia quickly. Others say, but if Russia is not, you know, actually willing to make peace, well, we can intensify sanctions and so on. I mean, if that's what they're doing, then, of course, that's classic negotiating behaviour.

James Bayes: Andre, one of the things that wasn't mentioned publicly in Riyadh, but we're hearing privately, is a possible part of the plan, is after an initial ceasefire, getting Ukraine to have elections. Now, I assume that is going to be something that will be welcomed in Moscow, where they keep criticising or questioning the legitimacy of President Zelensky, because his official term has run out.

Andrei Kortunov: That's exactly right. If you look at the official Russian narrative, they argue that since the term of Zelensky expired last year, Zelensky can no longer sign any agreements on behalf of Ukraine. And before entering any deal with Kyiv, the Russian side should be sure that the Kyiv leadership is legitimate. That's why they insist on elections prior to signing any kind of political settlement with the Ukrainian leadership. Of course, we'll understand that it is very difficult to have elections right now. But maybe there is a possibility to have elections between a ceasefire and some kind of a final peace agreement.

James Bayes: Mateo, what does Zelensky do now? He tried initially, after Trump took office on January the 20th, to be very diplomatic. That changed this week in Munich. He was much tougher, saying he didn't like what was going on. Since Riyadh, he's now said that Trump is living in a disinformation space and a circle of disinformation. But then Trump is also attacking him and oddly saying that it was his fault that the war started in the first place. What does Zelensky do now?

Matija Neles: It's utterly disturbing to hear Russian narratives spewed out, spewed and repeated by the U.S. president. Wrong claims, 4% approval rating, Trump said Zelensky has. That is absolutely wrong. This is really what we know studying Russian propaganda is what is being repeated. So it's worrying for Ukraine has a weak hand and it has to play this weekend very well. It has to connect with the Europeans and make sure that the Ukrainians are not against elections. Europeans are in favor of elections, but the conditions have to be there in order to execute those. And the conditions are not yet there. And in Germany, in the U.S., I guess it would be the same. Under martial law, elections are very difficult to uphold. And that means millions of people had to flee the country. Millions are in the European Union. There are millions or more than a million servicemen serving the front lines. So just to think about the practicalities of elections in the absence of any sort of security guarantees is impossible. So Zelensky now has to engage the Americans and say, listen, we don't see a plan yet. The Ukrainians and Europeans haven't heard any contours of the plan yet. We hear the desire to come to a quick ending of the war. OK, but what is the how is it being done? What is the role of Ukraine and the Europeans in this process? If you want Americans, if the Americans want Europeans to pay for this, then at least they have to be part of the conception. And again, Ukraine will not accept any deal in which they are not part of the making of the plan. So you really have to sit down and come to an agreement on the basic principles of what a future agreement could look like.

James Bayes: Anatole, I think we'd all agree that Zelensky now has a very, very weak hand in negotiations. He is going to have to rely on the Europeans. What do you think are the chances of the Europeans stepping up and there being any unity from the European side?

Anatole Levin: I mean, the Europeans can, of course, and will no doubt continue their economic and military aid to Ukraine. But, you know, the Paris meeting where Macron was, you know, trying to propose a European peacekeeping force for Ukraine was a, I'm afraid, complete failure. Because the other European countries, including even Poland, you know, which is Ukraine's biggest supporter, simply said that they would not provide troops or others, including Starmer, the British PM, said they would only do so if this force was guaranteed by the Americans. Which the Trump administration had already said America would not do. So the European options are now limited. But as I say, I mean, the critical European role is the economic future of Ukraine and Ukraine's ability to move towards membership of the European Union. That, of course, is something that only the Europeans can decide on and help. And that is something which the Russians have accepted, which must be guaranteed in a peace settlement. And which does, if this can be agreed, this does give Ukraine a path towards membership of the West. In many ways, a more important path than membership of NATO.

James Bayes: Andrei, are there concerns there in Russia of a situation where Ukraine fights on with European support, but not US support?

Andrei Kortunov: Well, of course, there are concerns that the European assistance to Ukraine can even grow. And therefore, this fighting can continue. However, I think that the perception in the Russian leadership is that even if the European assistance continues, it will not change the whole momentum which appears to favour Russia rather than Ukraine. This is the impression you get when you hear what is said in the Kremlin and around the Kremlin.

- **Summary:** The news presenter, Nick Clark, recaps the top stories, including the return of Israeli captives' bodies, an upcoming Arab leaders meeting on Gaza, and the war of words between the Ukrainian and US presidents.
- **Key persons:** ['Nick Clark (News Presenter)', 'Oded Elifchitz (Israeli captive)', 'Sidi Bebas (Israeli captive)', 'Tarek Abouzoum (Al Jazeera Correspondent)', 'Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (Egyptian President)', 'Kamal Bayoumi (Former Egyptian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs)', 'Donald Trump (US President)', 'Vladimir Zelenskyy (Ukrainian President)', 'Yoon Suk-yeol (Impeached South Korean President)']
- **Summary (ru):** В новостном выпуске сообщается о передаче тел четырех израильских заложников, убитых в Газе, для судебно-медицинской экспертизы, а также о предстоящей встрече арабских лидеров для обсуждения плана по Газе и реакции на план Трампа. Также упоминаются словесная перепалка между Зеленским и Трампом и продолжающиеся бои в Украине.

Nick Clark: Hello, I'm Nick Clark in Doha. The top stories here on Al Jazeera. And the bodies of four Israeli captives released from Gaza have been taken to a forensic centre in Tel Aviv. Among them are Oded Elifchitz, Sidi Bebas, and her two children, who were nine months old and four years old when they were taken during the October 7th attack. Israeli authorities will identify the bodies and determine the circumstances of their deaths. Hamas says they were killed by Israeli strikes. It marks the first time deceased captives have been released from Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect last month.

Tarek Abouzoum: Tarek Abouzoum is following developments from RAFA in southern Gaza. This development has seen us a critical symbolic step in the current ceasefire process where the handover of the four bodies today to the International Committee of the Red Cross reflects Hamas' willingness to completely engage seriously in the second phase of the ceasefire deal and giving clear indication that they are ready to be engaged also in diplomatic dialogue that will facilitate a very smooth transition for the second phase of negotiations, for the second phase of the ceasefire deal.

Nick Clark: An emergency meeting of the Arab leaders is due to take place in response to Donald Trump's plan to take control of Gaza. Security sources say that Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is set to travel to Saudi Arabia on Thursday to discuss an Arab plan for the Strip. The plan may include up to $20 billion from the region for reconstruction.

Kamal Bayoumi: Kamal Bayoumi is a former Egyptian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs to the European Union. He says Arab leaders will not agree to Trump's plan to get Palestinians to leave Gaza. I evaluate this event like the following. If they agree on a date and they meet, this is one step forward. If they agreed upon the agenda and a common declaration, then another way or another step for success. But the success, really, in my opinion, it is a big no we are giving to Mr. President Trump. Because, really, I do not envy him at all. He is a man with many experts around him, and he doesn't care to ask for an opinion. This is the first time in history that we are asking people of a country to leave their own country to let another people coming from Russia or China or Europe or even United States to come and to replace them.

Nick Clark: A war of words has erupted between the presidents of Ukraine and the United States. Vladimir Zelenskyy hit back at scathing criticism from Donald Trump, who branded him a dictator and blamed him for the war in Ukraine.

Vladimir Zelenskyy: We stand strong on our two feet. I rely on Ukrainian unity, on our Ukrainian courage, on our relations with partners, on our European solidarity, and on America's pragmatism. Because America needs success just as much as we do. Success brings us together. Our unity is the strongest safeguard of our future. A future not with Putin, but with peace. And this is a choice for the whole world, especially for the strongest nations, to stand with Putin or with peace. The right choice is peace. I thank everyone for their support.

Nick Clark: Meanwhile, fighting is continuing on the ground. A top Russian military official says troops are making advances in the Kursk region. It's been occupied by Ukrainian forces for nearly six months. Yoon Suk-yul has become South Korea's first sitting president to face a criminal trial. He was arrested last month for insurrection after briefly imposing martial law. Yoon could face life in prison or the death penalty. Rights groups have raised concerns about the safety of migrants deported from the US to Panama. Panama's government has agreed to take in and organise a repatriation of those from countries refusing to accept deportation flights from America. Migration lawyers say sending them home could be dangerous. Local media says that the migrants are being detained in a hotel in Panama City. All right, we're up to date with the headlines. Got more news coming up after the El Masri case.
