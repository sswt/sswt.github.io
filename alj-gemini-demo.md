[2025-02-22 03:07:44.100 - 2025-02-22 03:07:50.080] Gaza, a mammoth task which is going to take up to 10 years. But there's absolutely no
[2025-02-22 03:07:50.080 - 2025-02-22 03:07:56.920] doubt that those GCC countries committing themselves to rebuilding Gaza will have conditions
[2025-02-22 03:07:56.920 - 2025-02-22 03:08:04.500] attached to the commitments they're going to make, particularly the terms of the reconstruction,
[2025-02-22 03:08:04.500 - 2025-02-22 03:08:11.760] but most importantly the issue of who is going to take over Gaza. There is a growing consensus
[2025-02-22 03:08:11.760 - 2025-02-22 03:08:17.700] now that it's about time to consider handing over control of the area to the Palestinian
[2025-02-22 03:08:17.700 - 2025-02-22 03:08:23.480] authority. Now, when it comes to that particular issue, they're going to go to the Egyptian

[2025-02-22 03:08:29.480 - 2025-02-22 03:08:37.240] to come up with a unified stance. First of all, an alternative to the Trump proposal.

## 2. Trump's Gaza Plan Backpedal

start: 2025-02-22 03:09:01.760, duration: 96.12

- **Summary:** President Trump clarified that his plan for the U.S. to take over and redevelop Gaza is a recommendation, not a demand. He expressed surprise at Egypt and Jordan's reluctance to take in Palestinian refugees and suggested all Palestinians would want to leave.
- **Key persons:** ['Donald Trump (U.S. President)', 'Patti Kolhain (Reporter)']
- **Summary (ru):** В новостном сегменте обсуждаются недавние комментарии президента Трампа относительно сектора Газа. Трамп предложил, чтобы США взяли сектор Газа, перестроили его и избавились от Хамаса, но после негативной реакции он отступил от этой идеи.

### Processed text

Well, Patti Kolhain has more now on the recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump. He pretty much laid out what his original plan was, that the U.S. would take the Gaza Strip, redevelop it, get rid of Hamas, and keep it. Those are things that his aides have tried to say, no, he didn't really mean to say that. But now he is saying that this is just a recommendation, that he's not going to demand it be implemented. He said he was surprised that Egypt and Jordan didn't want to take in the millions of Palestinians. And he said that it's such a horrible, horrible conditions that, given the chance to leave, he believes all the Palestinians would, in fact, want to leave. And just to give you a sense that really indicated he maybe doesn't understand the history, very complicated history in this region. He talked about the fact that he surprised Israel ever left, that it was a horrible deal. But then he said, maybe the Israelis are looking at us and saying, why did you ever leave the Panama Canal? So very much trying to describe this as a real estate transaction. But I think the important part here is, after the pushback, we see...We see... from not just the region, but the entire world. The president is starting to signal that he realizes that he does not have the ability to impose basically getting rid of all of the Palestinians. So he seems to be, with Trump, he either goes, okay, well, that's fine, I didn't really want it. Or he says, doubles down and says, for example, Egypt and Jordan, if you want this billions of aid, then you're gonna have to do this. So he's definitely giving the indication that it's the latter, that he's going to just sort of let this one go, at least for now.

The UN Security Council has condemned Rwanda's backing of M23 fighters in Democratic Republic of Congo for the first time.
He called on Kigali to immediately withdraw troops in support for M23.
UN experts say 4,000 Rwandan soldiers are supporting the rebel group, which has seized swathes of territory in the eastern DRC in recent weeks.
Kristen Salumi has been following developments from the United Nations in New York.
Well, the Security Council had a meeting and it took them two weeks to get there, but they unanimously passed a resolution on the situation there.
And...
The fact that it was unanimous, all 15 council members supported it, shows growing international concern about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The resolution calls for an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of forces there, including the M23. And it calls on Rwanda to stop its support for the M23, something that they've denied doing. Rwanda's denied supporting the M23 and deflected on that in the Security Council. The resolution also condemns systematic and illicit exploitation of mining in the region, something that's added to the tensions and the interest in this area so much. So we've had some very strong words coming from the Security Council.
It did take them two weeks to negotiate that in the fall of major cities like Goma and Bukavu in the process. But in the end, they came out with this unanimous resolution binding under international law. At the same time, we're seeing countries unilaterally attempt to put pressure on Rwanda and the M23. The United States just issued sanctions on a government official in Rwanda, the EU.
calling Rwandan officials to the capital for talks and discussions.
So clearly there's growing concern on the part of the international community and this is the result.
Well, despite this, Rwandan-backed M23 forces are still advancing on another city in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo after capturing large areas of territory in recent weeks.

of backing the M23 rebels. The deteriorating relationship between Ukraine and the US has been dealt another blow. President Donald Trump has doubled down on anti-Ukraine rhetoric, saying the country needs to come to the negotiating table, despite barring Ukraine's leadership from earlier talks with Russia. I've had very good talks with Putin and I've had not such good talks with Ukraine. They don't have any cards, but they play it tough. But we're not going to let this continue. This war is terrible. It would have never happened if I were president president. But it did happen. So I got stuck with it. And the whole world is stuck with it. And right now you have a country that has its cities. They look like demolition sites. Those beautiful towers, those thousand-year-old gold. The golden domes that were so beautiful, the most beautiful in the world, they say. They were all in smithereens. Millions of people are killed, I think far more people than anyone understands. And we have people that better get to the table and get it ended. Well, Trump's comments come as his administration pushes Kyiv to sign a controversial rare earth minerals agreement. Discussions are ongoing in the Ukrainian capital between the U.S. envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, and President Vladimir Zelensky. The deal would give the U.S. revenue from some of Ukraine's mining industries and resources to make up for aid provided over the course of nearly three years. While President Zelensky has called the latest round of talks in Kiev extensive and positive. Today we also had a lot of international activities, with General Kellogg a meeting that restores hope. We need strong agreements in the United States, agreements that will truly work. I gave instructions to work swiftly and very sensibly. Economy and security must always go hand in hand, and the details of the agreement matter. The better they are structured, the better the results.

When the Mexican drug law, this male Zambardo, was arrested in Texas last year. It sent shockwaves through the Sinaloa cartel, which he had formerly led. At the time, U.S. officials said... There. At the time, U.S. has already been used to the public motorist. On the left, still there has been a number of the two-year-old cars that? It was almost being used to be used to the public motorists! It's basically a difference between other people who are treated for the people whose interests are being recruited. that his arrest was a major step in fighting organised crime and illegal fentanyl production. But now Zambada, who's in prison in New York, is trying to return home. John Holman reports now from Mexico City. Ismael Zambada, otherwise known as El Mayo, formerly a leader of the powerful Sinaloa cartel and now in a US prison facing multiple criminal charges, has sent a letter to the Mexican consulate in New York asking to be repatriated to his home country. Mexican media report that the letter makes the case that his detention wasn't legal. It was bizarre. El Mayo had said in an earlier letter that Joaquin Guzman, one of his rivals in the Sinaloa cartel, kidnapped him and then bundled him on a plane in a rural Mexican airstrip and flew him, together with Guzman himself, to Texas. There, US officials were waiting for them. The suspicion in Sinaloa has always been that Guzman handed over El Mayo to get a better deal for himself and his brother, Ovidio Guzman, already in US custody. The Mexican government at the time said that US authorities didn't tell them about the plan. On Friday, President Claudia Sheinbaum weighed in on the issue. Thank you. Thank you. She appeared to think there could be merit in Elmayo's case. Imagine another person beyond this individual and the crimes they may have committed. The issue at hand is the right of a Mexican citizen when facing trial abroad without having gone through the proper legal process. So yes, there is an issue in the letter being sent that relates to sovereignty and the judicial process. Ultimately, of course, this rests with the U.S. authorities who will likely be reluctant to give up Elmayo, a key leader in a cartel that they've just designated as a terrorist organisation and whose arrest they announced with great fanfare. Meanwhile, the Mexican government also has its hands full with the war in Sinaloa that the capture of Elmayo sparked. The government's desperately trying to subdue that conflict even as Ismail Zambada tries to get home. John Holman, Al Jazeera, Mexico City.

Parties are holding their final campaign rallies ahead of Sunday's general election. The conservative CDU-CSU bloc is leading opinion polls with around 30% of the vote. But all parties have refused to work with the far-right, AFD, which has recently surged in popularity. Germany is likely to face weeks of negotiations before parties can form a coalition government.
But one of the most urgent tasks for the next government is to fix Germany's ailing infrastructure. Europe's economic powerhouse wants an example of efficiency and punctuality is outdated. Sepp Wassen reports from Dresden.
A few minutes after the last tram passed one night in September, the 55-year-old Carola Bridge collapsed into the River Elbe. Nobody was injured, but the broken bridge has become a symbol for the dire state of Germany's infrastructure.
I am almost 80 years old, and I have never experienced that a bridge collapses, not even during socialism. It's unbelievable. It's all been neglected.
5,000 highway bridges are said to be in critical state. 7,000 kilometers of motorways and 4,000 kilometers of train tracks are in urgent need of repair. Traveling in Germany has become a challenge with long traffic jams and trains often cancelled. This in a country famous for its punctlichkeit, punctuality.
When we talk in school about German characteristics, punctuality is still one of them. But I think this is wrong. Nobody seems to care anymore.
Germany was once seen as an economic miracle, quickly recovering and booming after World War II. Its industrialization and design became an example to others. But the infrastructure has aged, and maintaining it has not been a priority. Yes, it impacts the economy and the whole society. Yes, it impacts the economy and the whole society.

Hello there.
The weather's looking very settled across South Asia at the moment.
But barely a cloud in the sky for much of India and Sri Lanka.
A few showers kicking off towards the east.
They will turn into some thunderstorms.
We have got warnings out in Odisha and West Bengal with a chance of lightning with those.
The wet weather extends from the northeast of India where it picks up on Sunday through across into Bhutan and Nepal.
But it's much drier as we push into Pakistan, that west coast of India.
We are expecting some wet weather to arrive in Sri Lanka.
Colombo seeing those thunderstorms on Monday afternoon.
And the wet weather is set to slip its way further east towards Shanghai from western parts of China.
Some snow expected on the mountains here.
Yeah, the wetter weather pushing its way further south into Taiwan as well.
Across the north of China, it's colder but clearer with sunshine in Beijing,
extending across into the Korean Peninsula as we go into Sunday.
But it is set to get colder.
And with that, we're set to see some wintry weather sweep again into Japan
with some heavier snow falling in Hokkaido,
but some touching down into Honshu on Sunday.
As the cold winter weather continues, people in Gaza have no choice
but to find what little shelter they can.
Understanding the reality.
We are alive. African art is alive.
Reporting from the action.
Everybody we've spoken to wants peace, but many of them don't want peace at any cost.
Al Jazeera's teams across the world bring you closer to the heart of the story.
Fighting is intensifying in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The Rwanda-backed M23 group is making further territorial advances.
So, with diplomacy failing, what are the risks the conflict may escalate
into another regional war?
The Rwanda-backed M23 group of people are looking for such a result of such a thing in common

This is Inside Story.
Hello again, I'm James Bayes. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, anxiety is growing in the capital Kinshasa. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels are advancing in the east, spreading out across north and south Kivu, and are now aiming for the city of Uvira. This is happening at such a rapid pace that it's stirring up memories of events of three decades ago. Many regional players are involved, including Uganda, Burundi and South Africa, and that's causing concern the conflict could spread beyond the DRC. Can M23 rebels push all the way to Kinshasa?
More on this in today's programme, which we begin with this report from Dmitry Medvedenko.
In Uvira, everyone is running away, says the man filming this video as gunfire is heard.
So, let's throw it to Kinshasa, why can we go abroad?
How about the CDC?
We don't know where to prepare.
Correct, I will use it to build up.
We don't know where to prepare the current current sources of water.
So, we don't know how to prepare.
We don't know how to prepare, but we can prepare for some of these resources.
Local militia fighters urge people not to panic as Congolese army troops retreat from the area.
Rwandan-backed M23 rebels are advancing on this town by Lake Tanganyika that borders Burundi, about 80 kilometers south of Bukavu.
The rebels took control of Goma in January and then Bukavu in southern Kivu weeks later.
The pace at which M23 has been advancing has alarmed people in the capital, Kinshasa, 1,500 kilometers away.
The government must take its responsibilities, review how the army functions and restore the chain of command.
For example, the town of Bonagana was taken without any effort, as was Minova.
I call on the head of state not to negotiate.
We must fight against them.
If someone hits you, what should you do?
We must fight back.
The UN says the war has forced hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.
South Africa has been sending additional troops to join the Congolese army in fighting M23 after 14 of its soldiers.
That has been waiting for many reasons.
It is a strong leading vol.
American war.
The World.
14 of its soldiers.
It is a strong reprendre.
That is a strong fight for the south.
That is a strong fight for the public.
That is a strong fight.
It is a strong fight.
It is a strong fight for the nation.
were reported to have been killed last month the presence of burundi forces on the ground is fanning fears the fighting in congo could expand into a larger regional conflict the commitment to a political solution is one that is uh unwavering first of all for the drc but also for all countries of the region as well as for the security council so i think it is an important takeaway to say that everyone is committed to a political solution the fighting must end and for that the rwandan troops must withdraw the democratic republic of congo and the united nations say rwanda supports the m23 rebels with arms and troops the congolese government also says kigali is using the group as a proxy army to capture the country's resources in the east worth trillions of dollars dimitri medvedenko al jazeera for insight story

well let's discuss all of this now with our panel of guests today and in akra in ghana we have
cambale musavuli a researcher the center for a search on the congo in upsala sweden angela
mavumbo selstrom she's a senior researcher at the nordic african institute and in washington dc
abdullahi halakhi is a peace and policy
analyst and senior advocate at Refugees International. Thank you all of you for joining
us today. Angela, let me start with you. Are you surprised by what we've seen this year?
Are you surprised by M23's progress? I'm not surprised, actually. I mean, M23 has
grown in stature and in scale and size in the last five years or so. The negotiations that
were ongoing and led by Angola in December of 2024 broke down. And that was partly because
there was a sort of a dispute between the government of the DRC and other actors involved in the
process about the inclusion of M23 in negotiations. The result of the last months are also partly
a reflection of changes in the geopolitical landscape. And I think for M23 and for other
actors, it's evident geopolitically that there is an opportunity.
now to actually go on in terms of military goals and objectives and move quite rapidly towards
crossing certain boundaries that have existed in the past when external actors would have
been much more reluctant to allow or to permit encroachment on territorial sovereignty of a
state. Kambale, let me bring up one of the absolute central issues, if I may, which is the
involvement of Rwanda. Rwanda says it's not backing the M23. Everyone from President Paul Kagame down
is saying that. What is the reality? Because I don't think there's anyone in the international
community who now believes that. I believe for President Paul Kagame, he actually stated that
he doesn't know if his troops are in the DRC or not. And for everyone, the evidence is already
presented. We have drone surveillance, video evidence, photographic evidence, and people
on the ground who have confirmed this. So it's no longer an allegation. It is clear that thousands
of Rwandan troops from the Rwandan Defence Forces
are in the DRC.
OK, well, let me interrupt you there, if I can, Kambale.
Do we have estimates of the numbers?
How many Rwandan troops do we think are there?
How many M23 fighters do we think they are backing,
just to be clear?
The UN Group of Experts has quoted that since last year
at least 4,000 Rwandan Defence Force soldiers
are on Congolese soil.
And they submitted this evidence to the UN Security Council.
What we have seen so far, there has not been strong actions
up until yesterday.
Yesterday, the U.S. Secretary of Treasury
or the Treasury Office in the United States
put sanction on a former Rwandan general
who is currently the Minister of State
for Regional Cooperation, James Kabarebe,
and his name is part of the Rwandan Defence Force soldiers
retired and active who have been listed
in the UN Group of Experts report
as the commanders or the liaison
within the Rwandan army to the M23.
So, seeing that action is a path in the right direction.
But as you read it, at least for Congolese,
we are saying that the statement is still...
doesn't still sit well with Congolese because in Haiti says that James Kabarebe has been active
for the past 30 years, three decades. This tells us that the United States government has all
information they need or require to actually take action, but for 30 years they have not taken
action. And I hope this step in the right direction is a path to justice. So, action in
terms of some sanctions from the US, but the Security Council, Abdullahi, which was
meeting on Wednesday, the UN Security Council, has not taken action. It's certainly discussed
this quite a few times. In that meeting, the most recent meeting on Wednesday, the UN Secretary
General's envoy for the Great Lates, Huang Sia, said the risk of a regional conflagration
is more real than ever. History is repeating itself. I think it might be useful for you
to just explain the history of the 1990s for us and what's at stake.
I think what's at stake is the regional stability of the Red Lakes region. This is not the first
time, Ruan. These are intervening.
in the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of Congo, you know, towards the end of
the Cold War, when the former president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly known as
Zaire, was overthrown through a combination of Ugandans and Rwandans, and James Kaberebe played
a significant role in that. After that, when Rwandans, Rwandese, and Ugandans, but especially
the Rwandese, thought that they have installed their man in the form of Kabila Sr., he turned
against them, or at the very minimum, the Rwandese saw them being marginalized, and therefore
they launched another military attack to overthrow him in 1998, I think in August. But that brought
in so many African militaries in what was defined then as Africa's world war, where, by some
estimate, almost 5.4 million people died. I think we have not resolved some of those tight
notes that really led to that conflict, where Rwand, I think, at the very minimum considers.
that it faces an existential threat from the government
that was in power, that was deposed in 1994,
that is, inside the eastern part of the DRC,
and the question of the Rwandese, or at the very minimum,
the Tutsis, called Banyamulenge,
that occupy the regional eastern part of the DRC.
OK, I want to interrupt you there,
because I want Angela to take up the story.
Since then, and I think throughout history,
the eastern part of DRC has had very weak control
from the capital, Kinshasa.
It's more than 1,000 kilometres away,
and it's been a conflict zone ever since, hasn't it?
That's right. It's been a conflict zone ever since.
And, I mean, even just for the ostensible period
that we're discussing, I mean, it's been impossible
for Kinshasa, through successive governments and elections,
to have full territorial control over that region.
Nonetheless, I think that the population in eastern DRC
has been kind of like a football,
being kicked back and forth
between externally supported armed groups,
like M23 and the eight, the, the, there's,
Allied Defense Forces, the ADF, backing by different regional actors, but that's also
resulted in mass displacement.
Over 1.5 million people have been displaced regularly, and scales—I mean, huge—a large
scale of human rights violence, including sexual violence.
The combination of this and the fact that the Kinshasa government hasn't been able to also
implement strong governance institutions in Eastern DRC has further left the population
sort of prey to the predation of external actors, of external armed groups, as well as, of
course, the number—I mean, the over 100 militias and rebel groups and civil defense
units, and it's a highly militarized area.
I would argue that it is likely that the situation will worsen, but I don't really think it's
going to become—
World War III for Africa again.
I don't think we'll see a complete repeat.
I think we'll see something different than we saw in the 1990s
and late 1990s.
Let me bring in Kambale.
If we look at M23, they have been around for some time
and they did take GOMA once before in 2012,
only for a short period.
And then there was a special enforcement wing
of the UN Force Munusco called the Force Intervention Brigade
deployed with an offensive mandate
and they were pushed down and pushed back into Rwanda.
It's so different this time, isn't it?
Because I'm on my list here.
Tell me if I've left anyone out.
The forces that were in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,
you had Munusco, the UN peacekeeping force,
on paper 11,000 strong, although they weren't in South Kivu,
which is where M23 have now gone.
You've got the Congolese Armed Forces.
You had mercenaries reportedly from Romania and France
that had been hired by the Congolese.
You had another peacekeeping force
from the South African development community.
That's the regional grouping that was called SAMI DRC.
GESITALA

died. And you had troops from the neighbouring country Burundi, more than 10,000 soldiers
there from Burundi. And M23 has ploughed ahead, have they not, Kambali, and succeeded despite
all of those different forces? For all intended purposes, the M23 is the
run of defence forces. I mean, when you read the UN report, it's quite clear about what
is happening. We are fighting a superb military that's able to jam GPS system. What does
that mean? It means that the Congolese army cannot fly their planes in the area where the
rebels are. Who has this technology? The Rwandan military. We have a short-right system, right,
the short-air defence system used by the M23. You have not vision goggles. According to
an African intelligence newspaper, they have actually mentioned that the taking over of
the city of Goma was done with support of assault drones. Even Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary
General, in an interview with Frantz Van Katz, stated that the M23 have much more sophisticated
weapons of the weapons of the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S. and the U.S.
that even the U.N. forces.
So, it's the context to look at what is actually happening there.
Now, as you talk about the different armies involved,
they've come with different mandates.
The force intervention brigade that came in 2012
was actually an action of SADC,
where the U.N. did not want this force
to be outside of the U.N. jurisdiction.
That's how they were actually added.
So, what we've seen over the years
is that SADC nations have supported a path to peace
from a military perspective to bring about that.
But I'm also clear that the path to peace
is not going to come to military means, right?
It's going to come to diplomacy.
In 2012, what stopped the M23 was aggressive diplomacy.
Now, what are we talking about?
Western nations and international institutions,
such as the World Bank, the African Development Bank,
all availed aid to Rwanda.
That single action caused the diplomatic pressure internationally
for reigning in Rwanda.
Right now, that type of action has not reached.
We strongly believe, because of Rwanda's economy,
because of Rwanda's military support
from the Western nations,
that it's essential.
I'm sure for them to take similar actions, to rein in Rwanda, to be able to go back to
the negotiating table, to discuss about peace and stability.
But a military solution will not end the conflict.
It's diplomatic means.
Let me bring in Angela on that point.
I mean, is there anything militarily that can stop M23?
One of the things I noticed when they took Bukavu, they also took Kavumu, which is apparently
a big airport, which cuts off all of the supplies to the Congolese army.
That's right.
I mean, I would just have to agree with the others that I think that it is a question of
really being able to militarily engage and disarm, not just necessarily disarm, but neutralise
Rwanda, persuade and create incentives for the Rwandan government to in turn contain and
control M23.
I think that, diplomatically, there are a lot of weaknesses in such an effort.
You know, Burundi has withdrawn some of its forces.
I don't know if the reports from this week are true or not.
They've withdrawn, I believe, 10,000 of those forces.
Uganda, on the other hand, is deploying a bit more.
I think there's still quite a lot of uncertainty and back and forth.
And the region, I believe, would like to have a sort of status quo settlement.
But I think that the real pressure has to come from even further outside of the continent.
It will have to come from U.S. further strengthening its negative message
against Kigali to contain Kigali and to persuade Kigali to control M23.
And really, that is really the lever that needs to be pressed in order for all of these actors
to go back. I mean, there was some consensus between the East African community and the
Southern African development community around the diplomatic process to go for proceeding.
I think that that consensus could hold. But I do believe that there are major concessions
that Kinshasa will have to make. And ultimately, it will—there will have to be some sort of—
A negotiation that really takes into account the interests of Rwanda, the interests of M23,
the territorial integrity of the Congolese people and of the government in Kinshasa.
But that will be diplomatic and a political process.
But without strong, strong leverage against Rwanda, we will not get there.
Abdullahi, in terms of the M23 and where they are moving, they seem to be moving south, Uvira,
and that is right on the border with Burundi, on the shore of Lake Tanganyika,
less than 30 kilometres away from Bujumbura, which is the main city and used to be the capital.
I mean, we're involving more and more countries.
We'll come on to Uganda in a minute, but more and more countries...
I mean, they already had troops there, Burundi,
but more and more countries are getting directly involved.
Refugees are streaming into Burundi.
Yes, it is.
I think even while we are discussing the large strategic issues at play,
what we shouldn't lose sight of is the people who are paying the ultimate price are the Congolese,
the children and women in the DRC.
Last year, I was in Goma.
I met women.
you know, like not a single one of them who has not experienced, you know, sexual and gender-based
violence. And some of them told me, the people who committed these are people who are as young
as my children. So I think we shouldn't lose sight of that. But I think to your question around
Burundi, it's the fact that Burundians, Burundi and Rwanda doesn't enjoy a good relationship
because there is a rebel group that is based inside the DRC that the Burundians think are
being supported or alleged they are being supported by Rwanda to destabilize Burundi. So therefore,
they are not just the interests of the DRC, there are other moving interests of other countries that
are using the DRC as a base from where they destabilize not just the DRC but countries in
the region. But fundamentally, though, we have to get back to the question of
what is in the interest of DRC. Everybody has their own interest, but DRC also has its own
interest. And I think, fundamentally, the citizens of DRC who continue to endure
egregious human rights violations, women and children being raped consistently as a tool of
war by various actors, including allied militias that work with the DRC government. That has to
stop. It doesn't matter how insecure Rwanda feels, but I think the people of the DRC, especially in
the East, deserve much more than it is getting right now. Kambale, earlier Angela mentioned
briefly Ugandan forces, because we've got Burundi now and then Uganda. They've gone to the capital
of Ituri province, Bunia. Do we think, because in the past they have been allied with Rwanda,
but they've also recently been in support of the DRC. Do we know exactly what Uganda is doing there?
I'm sorry to keep referencing the UN group of experts, because they've been very clear and
sharing the evidence. Right now, the M23 have been training in Kampala, according to the UN group of
experts. Not only that, that they've been entering the DRC from the Ugandan border.
So you are suggesting that Uganda is on the side of Rwanda?
Yes, but it's not me. It's the human group of experts presenting that to us at the Security Council, right?
It's not an opinion for myself. It's the facts on the ground, right?
So, we do know that UPDF commanders, that's the Ugandan People's Defense Force, the military,
have been instructors in the camps where the M23 is training.
We also know that M23 crosses the border of Uganda to DRC
without being stopped by a Ugandan government, military, or border patrol, or whatever they may have.
And a recommendation from the UANA group of experts is that the Ugandan government need to take action
around the evidence that's been presented to them, which they have not.
So, I will not be surprised to see another front actually created on the top.
But I think it's important to point out the last intervention about the interest of the Congolese.
The interest of the Congolese lies into Patrice Lumumba's Independence Day speech, where he says
is that Congo's minerals, Congo's land, Congo's resources, should belong to the Congolese
people.
It should be exported for the benefit of the people.
What we are seeing is not that, right?
As we are talking about killing the interests of foreign nations, Iran, what they need in
the country, mineral resources needed for the fourth industrial revolution continue to come
out of the Congo.
Congo's cotton is being exported, Congo's lithium is also being exported, gold and so
on, right?
So we must know, as we even talk about the complexity of the conflict, that in the real root cause
is control of Congo's mineral wealth.
And it has appeared over Congo's history in multiple forms.
So to address that is for nations who are consuming these minerals to hold corporations
accountable.
That's why seeing the sanctions around James Kabarebe, where he pointed out very clearly,
right?
This Rwandan defense minister is facilitating the export of minerals from DRC to the outside
world.
No speculation.
This is why we are sanctioning him, putting the names of the companies, right?
The Kingston holding register in Paris, I believe, and also in the UK, that it shouldn't be presented
as a mysterious...
No.
No.
No.
No Atlantis.
No.
No!
No.
No.

He point.

It doesn't even mean, you know what?

Well, we do not know the actors, we do not know the companies,
Africans are wantonly killing each other.
OK.
That we need to talk with the people involved.
Angela, I was interested to read that some embassies in Kinshasa,
Western embassies, including the US and the UK,
have evacuated most of their staff
because they're worried about the situation.
I mean, do you think there is any possibility
M23 may want to push all the way to the capital?
And just a quick point of geography,
that's over 1,500 kilometres away.
But, of course, there is the precedent of 1997, isn't there?
Yes, that's true.
But it was a different time.
I mean, the government in the Kinshasa,
the DRC government was significantly weaker, I think,
and had less experience with waging a kind of dance
dance with Rwanda, with Kigali at that time.
In this regard, I think that I'm very sceptical
that M23 will go all the way to Kinshasa.
I don't think it needs to go
all the way to Kinshasa.
I mean, I think it needs to threaten, too.
I think that the threat of its military success and its control of Eastern DRC and its success
so far and its support from regional players really will create a kind of another lever,
a kind of lever, a negotiating position with Kinshasa.
I do believe that the real ambition here is to have control of Congo's rare minerals,
particularly from that part of the region.
I know that M23, just alone in taxes, I think, paid to it for extraction of some critical
minerals makes almost a million dollars a month or more just from that, not from the
actual costs of actual profits.
It's a kind of enslavement of the people of the Congo to production and extraction of
these minerals and to the global sort of financial system that supports it, the extraction.
But I don't believe that M23 can actually go all the way to Kinshasa.
We will see, though, I mean, if the U.S. doesn't really engage.
If there's not enough international pressure, I think between now and the next few months, then perhaps I would change my mind.
But simply by putting more pressure, like they did, I think, in 2012, a similar situation occurred, and there was significant pressure from the U.S., and that pulled back M23 occupation of Goma then.
So I'm a bit more sceptical.
Thank you very much, Angela.

She's there because the Israeli government and Palestinian Authority have banned Al Jazeera from reporting from inside Israel and the occupied West Bank. It will take the forensic teams in Israel several hours before they can determine the identity of the remains handed over to the Red Cross by Hamas, reportedly containing the remains of Shiri Bibas. The initial confusion happened after four coffins were turned over to the Red Cross and then going down to Israel... authorities. They were supposed to have the remains of Sheri Bibas, her two children, and another Israeli captive. Upon examination, that did not turn out to be the case. There was apparently a mix-up, and according to Palestinian groups, that probably happened after the Israeli bombardment of the site in which they were held. Israeli and Palestinian families are looking forward to Saturday morning, when the largest exchange of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners and detainees will happen. Six living Israeli captives will be released on Saturday in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians, mostly in Gaza, but many also to the occupied West Bank and to exile. After this release is concluded, there will be four remaining bodies of Israeli captives, and that would conclude phase one of the ceasefire agreement, which ends on March the 1st.

and Al Jazeera after the El Masri case.
Stay with us.
In 2004, Khaled El Masri is arrested during a trip to Macedonia.
He is interrogated and mistreated.
Nobody knows his whereabouts.
Five months later, he is released in a forest in Albania.
They turned me in a certain direction so that I didn't see the transports.
And he showed me with my fingers that I should not look back to the back.
I should go back to the road.
The Khaled El Masri case basically revealed the entire underbelly of the scene.
a secret American torture and prison system.
Khaled El Masri made international headlines.
For years he fought in vain for explanations and justice.
He felt abandoned by his own government.
Khaled El Masri used to live in the area of Ulm.
Qhalle del Masri used to live in the area of Ulm.
I have known him since 2007.
Even then I wanted to make a film about him.
But then his case took a bizarre turn.
Years after the kidnapping, he committed several disturbing crimes
and in 2009 beat up the mayor of Neu-Ulm.
How did it come to this?
One who was probably most deeply involved in this story
was the lawyer Manfred Gnidic from Ulm.
He first met Khaled El Masri in 2004.
Then there were two men in front of the Kanzlei, long-haired,
and one had even a long neck neck and said to me,
what do they want from me?
Then we came to the room and then it was explained to me,
what should actually be said.
Then he started to tell and said that he was taken away from the Americans,
and everything.
Hey, hey, hey, why are you talking about me?
Also, what do you want from me?
And then he showed me his pass.
And his story was,
he was from Germany to Macedonia.
And then it was actually so,
that he had an Einreisestempel to go to Macedonia,
but not an Ausreisestempel.
I was like,
it was also like the king of France.
And he was very confused.
And he did not know that he would pick him down.
I was like,
you know,
I don't know.
What do I want from you?
Because when I was getting back into town,
I had to say,
I had to say,
and he took him down.
But I had to say,
at the top,
I said he was,
he made it so beyond me.
And then he had a trip from Albania.
How?
God, he came from Macedonia to Albania.
And then came to the idea,
if this is a Räuber-Pistole,
then he has to do that.
With such stories,
but it is true.
At about the same time as Manfred Gnidic,
the New York Times became aware of the case.
Suat McKennett had just started working there.
She was still living in Germany at that time.
So, the journalist who Suat McKennett
asked me, who is there?
Yes, but who are they?
And the answer is,
but I asked them to ask her,
who is there?
And the answer is,
who is there?
Who is there?
Who is there?
Who is there?
Who is there?
Who is there?
My name is Khaled al-Masri, I'm from the CIA entführt.
It was the mix of his voice, his voice.
However, I also knew that this is a very big story,
it's a very big story against the CIA.
That's a direct attack against the U.S.
And that was for me too big.
But I also wanted to know, who is this man?
Who is Khaled al-Masri?
And why should the CIA entführt him?
The 9-11 attack of 2001 shocked the Western world.
The U.S. was determined to use all its power to fight back
and had the backing of its allies.
I have the American President, George Bush,
the uninscredited Solidarity of Germany.
The U.S. was given.
The U.S. was given.
The U.S. was given.
The U.S. was given.
Khaled is from Lebanon. When the civil war began in 1975, he was 12 years old.
Ten years later, he managed to flee to Germany.
In 1994, Khaled became a German citizen. He wanted to build up something in the country
that had granted him asylum. He tried to trade cars. In 1996, he got married.
In 2002, he moved to a village near Ulm. At the time, he lived with his wife and children
in a 30-square-meter basement.
At the end of 2003, there were problems at home. Khaled decided to take some time off.
He booked the cheapest ticket he could find, a bus trip to Macedonia for about 150 euros.
At the Serbian-Macedonian border, something bizarre happened. He had to leave the
to leave the
to leave the
to leave the
to leave the
Bus. Hours later, he was taken to a hotel in Skopje.
Im Hotelzimmer, ich glaube, das war im vierten Stock, nehme ich an.
Drei Männer sind bei mir im Zimmer geblieben.
Dann habe ich sie gefragt, ob ich verhaftet bin.
Ich habe gesagt, sehen Sie irgendwo ein Schellen oder irgendwas?
Und dann sind wir dort geblieben, ungefähr 30 Tage im Hotel festgehalten.
Ich durfte nicht telefonieren oder irgendwelche Kontakte irgendwohin.
Und ich wusste nicht, warum oder was die wollen.
Dann habe ich gesagt, okay, dann will ich Kontakt zur Deutschen Botschaft.
Dann hat er gesagt, aber die Deutschen wollen mit Ihnen nicht sprechen.
Und behauptet, es sei ein Ägypter und mein Pass sei gefälscht.
Irgendwann war ich wütend, bin ich aufgestanden und sagte, jetzt gehe ich.
Und dann sind die in Stellung gegangen in dem Raum und haben ihre Waffen gezogen.
Es soll...
or they will shoot.
And the situation was really serious,
as I saw it.
Then I went back to the bed.
A few days later,
they said to me,
I'm going back to Germany.
Then they opened my eyes
and opened my eyes.
They opened my eyes and opened my eyes.
And then there was still a sack.
Im Flughafen hörte ich die Stimme von einem Assistent.
Jetzt werden sie in einen Nebenraum gebracht.
Dort werden sie ärztlich untersucht.
Dann gehen die Tiere zu.
Und dann bekomme ich Schläge von allen Seiten.
Irgendeine scharfe Gegenstände haben mich entgleitet.
Also meine Klamotten ganz weggemacht.
Ich war ganz nackt.
Und dann wurde ich in andere Kleidung.
So Sportanzug, Windeln und so weiter.
Und im Flugzeug haben die mich auf den Boden geworfen.
Und irgendwann bekam ich Spritze in der Schulter.
Und dann war ich weg.
Die Polizei erst lernen über die Abduktion in June 2004.
About two weeks after El Masri's return.
Sie checkten die Geschichte step-by-step.
Und haben sogar eine Haare-Analysis gemacht.

On the basis of the Nahrungsmangel,
there was also a hunger strike,
or something to eat, or something to drink,
because that's all about Eigenheiten,
there could also be the Aussage of the Aufenthalts
with the räumlichen order.
If it was a Räuberpistole, we would have had the rules for this, but we didn't have it,
because we went out of it, that the story is overall stimmig and trustworthy.
The police have worked super well, especially the police, and that worked very well.
All of a sudden it was still, there was nothing happened.
Then I had a conversation with the Staatsanwalt, and he said to me,
hmm, I think that is not so expected.
What is that?
What is that?
I started a little bit.
What is that?
I think it is a very interesting question.
What is that?
What is that?
What is that?
What is that?
to understand, that it is overplayed politically.
After months of research by Stuart McKennett,
the New York Times finally decided to publish the story.
As colleagues in the magazine,
also officially by the CIA,
he said,
that the story didn't happen.
It was terrifying.
It was a huge pressure.
And then she came.
The story came out,
the first page of the New York Times,
and of course,
it was like something else.
It was a huge pressure,
because the first hours,
when the story came out,
I really sat on the phone and on the screen,
and waited for the CIA
or the US government to say,
the New York Times is lying.
That didn't happen.
Bring me,
watch out.
I was working at the German television show Panorama, and when the story came out in the
New York Times that Sue McKenna had done about the kidnapping, I remember feeling shameful
that here was a case of a CIA kidnapping of a German citizen.
And you know, you have to ask yourself, why do we even exist?
In 2005, journalists discovered the flight routes of CIA jets and thus also the El Masri
flight to Afghanistan.
The Spanish police were able to ascertain the camouflage names of the CIA hijackers who
had made a stopover in Mallorca.
With this information, John Goetz scored a coup.
He identified the addresses of the CIA abductors in the United States.
Good morning.
Wir möchten Sie nach der Entführung von Khaled Al Masri fragen.
Ich bin John Goetz vom Deutschen Fernsehen.
Wissen Sie, wovon ich rede?
Sir?
Sir?
We wanted to talk about the...
Was sagen Sie zum Kidnapping von Khaled al-Masri in Mazedonien?
The involvement of the CIA was already known by journalist Alexander Bozhinowski in early 2004, shortly after the abduction.
On the FBI list of most wanted people tied with the 9-11 attacks, however, Khaled al-Masri they're looking for was a Spanish citizen, and this Khaled al-Masri with the same name, same surname, is a German citizen.
So he arrives in a Tabanovce border, Macedonian-Serbian border.
A policeman decided to move it to Skopje in the hotel Skopski Merak.
That's a hotel who was placed just behind the U.S. Embassy,
the old place of the U.S. Embassy in Skopje.
They didn't wait any information from Lyon, France, seat of Interpol,
to find out if the passport is genuine or not.
Instead, they informed the U.S. Embassy in Skopje,
and they informed, I guess, Washington or their superiors over there,
who sent the airplane to take muscle.
My source was an officer in the military intelligence.
I think that they told me because they're too excited.
They believe they have captured very big fish.
They become internationally famous by capturing one of the organizers of 9-11 attacks.
It was just too big thing to keep quiet.
Irgendwann habe ich gespürt wie eine Landung.
Und dann haben die mich in einem Kofferraum geworfen
und sind ungefähr 10 oder eine Viertelstunde gefahren mit dem Auto.
Und dann haben die mich ins Gefängnis.
Ich werde mich ins Gefängnis mit beschäftigen,
indem ich mich ins Gefängnis вижу Interesting,
sondern heute sind nur meine Firma 서울,
ich will mir die in eine Viertelstunde,

That was under the earth, also in the Keller.
And they had me left and left to the wall.
And there were a lot of creatures.
And then I saw,
that there was somewhere in a trashy room.
And it stinks like a cow.
I was very thirsty in this time.
And from the loch of the cell,
there was one that looked at me
with an afghanistan.
Then I told him,
that I would drink.
Then he told me,
that I had a plastic flashe
that I should drink from there.
Then I told him,
that the water is not clean.
Then he told me,
that either you don't get it or you don't get it.
Then he told me,
that because he was like,
that I don't know how to do it.
And he's like,
you know the other way.
I don't think so.
I can't believe it.
And I'm like,
that's what I want.
I don't think so.
I want to know the I don't know how to mix it.

There were two or three Americans who were not in front of the Mund,
so normal and civil.
They knew that I was from Ulm
and that I was going to the Multikultur house.
They knew that the car was on me.
Nobody knew that the car was on me.
They knew that the American people knew that the car was on me.
They said that they knew that they knew that they knew that they were not aware of what they were.

In New York in 2005, the human rights organization ACLU became aware of Kallet's case.
They specialized in tracking the CIA's abduction program.
Kallet's account of what happened to him was a credible story about United States' involvement and the CIA's involvement specifically in this program of transporting individuals to secret detention and torture.
Despite the fact that this was the home of his torturers, Kallet nonetheless got on the plane with Manfred, his lawyer.
We're going to win, we're going to win.
But the trip is less successful than anticipated.
The courts refuse to accept Khaled El Masri's case for reasons of national security.
At least he can testify in the courts.
The courts refuse to accept Khaled El Masri's case for reasons of national security.

And that's going to pick temperatures up, certainly for those southern states.
But the warmth will push its way all the way up to more central parts of Canada, so temperatures will be improving.
There's still some winter weather lingering around the east of Canada, but it's looking much drier, more settled across the east coast of the US.
With temperatures set to pick up for cities like New York and Washington DC in the days ahead.
Instead, it is going to look pretty wild for Sunday for the Pacific Northwest, western parts of Canada.

There was this whirlwind when the sand... and I understood that I was connected to the world. Dancers from around the world come to master the 64 unique movements she created, each shaped by nature. Some movements are inspired from the snail, and the idea here is to reconnect with nature unto humans. From the edge to the heart of the Sahel, beyond the violence lives a people searching for peace.

### Processed text

We don't simply focus on the politics of the conflict.
It's the consequence of war,
the human suffering that we report on.
We brave bullets and bombs
in some of the world's most troubled regions.
The army fled in the face of ISIL's advance.
It is one of the most serious bouts of violence in recent years.
In some instances, we are the targets
because we give voice to those demanding freedom,
the rule of law,
and we always include the views from all.
