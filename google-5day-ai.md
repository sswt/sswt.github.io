## Unit 1

Foundation models and prompt engineering

Assignments

1. Complete the Intro Unit – “Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation”, which is:

- [Optional] Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQDlCZZsOyo&feature=youtu.be) (31 min) for this unit (created by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)).
-  Read the [“Foundational Large Language Models & Text Generation” whitepaper](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-foundational-llm-and-text-generation) (75 pages).

2. Complete Unit 1 – “Prompt Engineering”, which is:

-  [Optional] Listen to the summary [podcast episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_hJ2Ey4BNc&feature=youtu.be)(18 min) for this unit (created by NotebookLM).
- Read the [“Prompt Engineering” whitepaper](https://www.kaggle.com/whitepaper-prompt-engineering)(65 pages).
-  Complete [this code lab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting) on Kaggle where you’ll learn prompting fundamentals. Make sure you [phone verify](https://www.kaggle.com/settings) your account before starting, it's necessary for the code labs.

**💡What You’ll Learn**

Today you’ll explore the evolution of LLMs, from transformers to techniques like fine-tuning and inference acceleration. You’ll also get trained in the art of prompt engineering for optimal LLM interaction.

The code lab will walk you through getting started with the Gemini API and cover several prompt techniques and how different parameters impact the prompts.

**📋 Reminders**

- Discord is the best place to ask questions – specifically in the [#5dgai-q-and-a](https://discord.com/invite/gNrC9Xut) channel. In addition to other participants, several Googlers are there to help. During the livestream, we'll also pick several questions from Discord to discuss. You'll get Kaggle swag if your question is chosen!
- We created a new channel in Discord called [#5dgai-announcements](https://discord.com/invite/RnVCPgX5) that will be used exclusively for course announcements from us.
- We want this course community to be positive and supportive. Please follow Kaggle’s community guidelines found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/community-guidelines).
